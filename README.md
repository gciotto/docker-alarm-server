# Alarm server docker container

A debian-based docker container holding the EPICS alarm server.

Execute `build-docker-alarm-server.sh` and `run-docker-alarm-server.sh` to create the Docker container and start the alarm service respectively. Do not use the latter for production. Instead, use of the deploy tools described in this [project](https://github.com/lnls-sirius/docker-alarm-composed).
